sentence=The RF24(AVR)-enabled version of TaskManager, a lightweight cooperative multitasking system for Arduino systems.
paragraph=The library replaces loop() with the ability to define multiple loop()-like procedures.  These are executed by a simple round-robin scheduler.  Built-in management allows a task to delay (passing control to other tasks) as well as pass messages between tasks.  Extensions allow tasks to run on a mesh of Arduino nodes that communicate using RF24 (Atmel) or WiFi (ESP-NOW on ESP-32) protocols.
